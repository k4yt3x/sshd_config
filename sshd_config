########## Binding ##########

# SSH server listening address and port
Port 22
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
ListenAddress ::

# listen to IPv4 and IPv6
AddressFamily any

########## Features ##########

# deny locale-related environment variables

# disallow ssh-agent forwarding to prevent lateral movement
AllowAgentForwarding no

# prevent TCP ports from being forwarded over SSH tunnels
# **please be aware that disabling TCP forwarding does not prevent port forwarding**
# any user with an interactive login shell can spin up his/her own instance of sshd
AllowTcpForwarding no

# prevent StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding
AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

# disables all forwarding features
# overrides all other forwarding switches
DisableForwarding yes

# disallow remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports
# i.e. forwarded ports are forced to bind to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0
GatewayPorts no

# prevent tun device forwarding
PermitTunnel no

# suppress MOTD
PrintMotd no

# disable X11 forwarding since it is not necessary
X11Forwarding no

########## Authentication ##########

# permit only the specified users to login
AllowUsers ubuntu

# permit only users within the specified groups to login
#AllowGroups k4yt3x

# uncomment the following options to permit only pubkey authentication
# be aware that this will disable password authentication
#   - AuthenticationMethods: permitted authentication methods
#   - PasswordAuthentication: set to no to disable password authentication
#   - UsePAM: set to no to disable all PAM authentication, also disables PasswordAuthentication when set to no
AuthenticationMethods publickey
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no

# challenge-response authentication backend it not configured by default
# therefore, it is set to "no" by default to avoid the use of an unconfigured backend
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# set maximum authentication retries to prevent brute force attacks
MaxAuthTries 5

# disallow connecting using empty passwords
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# prevent root from being logged in via SSH
PermitRootLogin no

# enable pubkey authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

########## Cryptography ##########

########## Connection Preferences ##########

# Debian-based distributions only
# hide the Debian banner to prevent information disclosure
# (e.g., `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-5+deb11u3`)
#DebianBanner no

# number of client alive messages sent without client responding
ClientAliveCountMax 5

# send a keepalive message to the client when the session has been idle for 1000 seconds
# this prevents/detects connection timeouts
ClientAliveInterval 1000

# compression before encryption might cause security issues
Compression no

# prevent SSH trust relationships from allowing lateral movements
IgnoreRhosts yes

# log verbosely for additional information
LogLevel VERBOSE

# allow a maximum of two multiplexed sessions over a single TCP connection
MaxSessions 5

# enforce SSH server to only use SSH protocol version 2
# SSHv1 contains security issues and should be avoided at all costs
# SSHv1 is disabled by default after OpenSSH 7.0, but this option is
#   specified anyways to ensure this configuration file's compatibility
#   with older versions of OpenSSH server
Protocol 2

# override default of no subsystems
# path to the sftp-server binary depends on your distribution
#Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
#Subsystem sftp /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server
#Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

# let ClientAliveInterval handle keepalive
TCPKeepAlive no

# disable reverse DNS lookups
UseDNS no

# Misc Hardening
